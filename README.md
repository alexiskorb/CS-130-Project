Multiplayer First Person Shooter Game Framework

The Multiplayer Game Framework is a framework for the Unity game engine that allows developers to add efficient lobby-based multiplayer to their game. It is implemented as a Unity project and illustrated through a simple first-person shooter game. It is intended primarily for use by Escality but can be adapted for many types of developers and games.

Created for UCLA course CS 130: Software Engineering.
